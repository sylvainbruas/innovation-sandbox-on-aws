## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Multi-user lease sharing enabling collaborative access to sandbox accounts with support for individual users and IAM Identity Center groups ([#15](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/15), [#77](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/77), [#89](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/89))
- In-app configuration management replacing AWS AppConfig with a DynamoDB-backed Admin Settings UI, with automated migration on upgrade
- Amazon Cognito authentication with SigV4 request signing, replacing the custom SAML + self-signed JWT implementation
- Machine-to-machine (M2M) API access via per-client IAM roles with CloudTrail audit trail and CLI helper scripts (`scripts/m2m/`) ([#19](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/19))
- Post-cleanup resource validation using AWS Resource Explorer to detect residual resources before account reuse
- Configurable account cooldown period after cleanup to ensure cost data settlement before reuse ([#70](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/70))
- Cleanup summary reports visible in the UI showing per-stage outcomes and execution history
- Account tagging for native AWS cost allocation, enabling Cost Explorer, Budgets, and Cost Anomaly Detection analysis by user, team, and lease template
- SCP customization parameters (`AdditionalAllowedServices`, `AdditionalPrincipalExceptions`, `BedrockInferenceProfilePatterns`) that persist across upgrades ([#74](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/74), [#83](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/83), [#39](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/39))
- 18 new services added to the baseline allowed services SCP including `sts:*`, `ssm-guiconnect:*`, `execute-api:*`, `ecr-public:*`, `eks-auth:*`, Bedrock AgentCore, S3 Tables, S3 Vectors, and Textract ([#59](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/pull/59) @YutaOkoshi, [#67](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/pull/67) @marcpeiser, [#73](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/pull/73) @chrisns, [#163](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/pull/163) @ia9, [#81](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/81), [#109](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/109), [#162](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/162))
- Manual account quarantine allowing administrators to temporarily isolate accounts from the UI ([#85](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/85))
- User self-service lease termination from the lease details page ([#33](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/33))
- Custom domain support for CloudFront with BYO ACM certificate ([#65](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/65))
- Support for multiple Innovation Sandbox deployments within the same AWS Organization via namespaced global resources ([#14](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/14))

### Fixed

- Account cleanup now passes the ISB spoke role to CloudFormation during stack deletion, resolving failures on stacks deployed with a creation role ([#118](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/118))
- Account cleanup no longer fails when AWS Security Incident Response is enabled in sandbox accounts ([#101](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/101))
- Concurrent cleanup executions no longer spuriously quarantine accounts
- Email notifications render properly formatted HTML anchor tags
- Fixed stale data displayed in UI after state changes

### Changed

- Authentication mechanism migrated from custom SAML + self-signed JWT to Amazon Cognito with SigV4 (**breaking** — post-deployment SAML app reconfiguration required; see [upgrade guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/update-the-solution.html))

### Removed

- Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights integration
- AppConfig extension from all non-nuke Lambda functions
- Custom JWT secret rotation Lambda and Secrets Manager secret
- SSO Handler Lambda (replaced by Cognito hosted UI)
- Amazon Lex V1 from the allowed services SCP

### Security

- API Gateway authorization migrated to IAM (SigV4)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Blueprint management for registering, configuring, and tracking CloudFormation StackSets as reusable infrastructure templates ([#34](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/34))
  - Configurable deployment strategies with region targeting, concurrency controls, and failure tolerance
  - Automated blueprint deployment to sandbox accounts during lease provisioning, orchestrated through AWS Step Functions
  - `Provisioning` and `ProvisioningFailed` lease statuses to track blueprint deployment progress during lease approval
  - Deployment history per blueprint with health metrics (successful deployments, deployment history, last deployment time)
  - Blueprint management UI with registration wizard, detail view, deployment history visualization, and editing for basic details and deployment configuration
  - Blueprint association on lease templates, allowing administrators to attach or detach blueprints during template creation or update
- Dedicated detail and edit pages for leases and lease templates covering duration, budget, cost report, and blueprint settings
- Version update alert in the navigation bar when a newer version of the solution is available ([#45](https://github.com/aws-solutions/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/issues/45))
- AWS WAF logging to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and alarm on blocked requests
- Validation that the `InnovationSandbox-<namespace>-SandboxAccountRole` role exists in a sandbox account before starting cleanup, reducing unnecessary cleanup attempts

### Fixed

- Sorting on date and status columns in frontend tables by adding dedicated sorting comparators
- Cross-stack reference issue where updates to the account pool stack were not reflected in the compute stack due to deploy-time resolution

### Changed

- Lease approval workflow now supports two paths: immediate access (no blueprint) or deferred access after blueprint deployment completes
- Miscellaneous UX improvements to the frontend application
