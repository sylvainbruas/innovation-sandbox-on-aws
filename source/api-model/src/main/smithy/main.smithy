// Model layout. The model is split across files, all merged by Smithy under
// `sources` by namespace:
//   - `common.smithy` — the JSend envelope, shared errors, and shared scalars
//     (`ContinuationToken`, `OwnerEmail`);
//   - `<domain>.smithy` (e.g. `lease-templates.smithy`) — each domain's operations,
//     shapes, and its per-domain service shape (e.g. `LeaseTemplatesApi`);
//   - this file — the aggregate `IsbApi` service.
//
// Service topology. ISB runs a Lambda per domain, so each domain has its own
// service shape whose generated `<Domain>ApiService` interface types that Lambda's
// handler to only its operations. `IsbApi` is the aggregate service that lists every
// operation and drives the single client, OpenAPI document, and (later) CLI model.
// smithy-build.json therefore has one `aggregate` projection (client + OpenAPI on
// `IsbApi`) and one `server-<domain>` projection (SSDK on each domain service); see
// `scripts/generate.mjs` for how the per-domain server outputs merge into one package
// with a subpath per domain. Every operation must be listed in both its domain service and
// `IsbApi` — `aggregate-service-parity.test.ts` enforces that. (Contrast DeepRacer,
// which keeps ONE service + ONE Lambda and groups domains with Smithy `resource`
// shapes; ISB's per-domain-Lambda topology is why we diverge to per-domain services.)
// Implementation/migration notes (NOT customer-facing — kept out of the emitted
// OpenAPI `info.description`, which is sourced from the `///` doc below):
//   - Additive during migration: this model describes a subset of the pre-Smithy
//     contract and is not yet authoritative for it. CDK owns paths, methods, and
//     integrations; handlers and middleware own wire behavior; operations move
//     under this model one domain at a time.
//   - The JSend envelope is written by the generated `restJson1` serializer for
//     migrated domains (a boundary shim restores the pre-Smithy wire) and by the
//     Middy middleware in `source/common/lambda/middleware/` for the rest. It is
//     modeled explicitly so generated clients deserialize the real wire format.
//   - The non-standard wire names below predate current AWS naming conventions;
//     the v1.3.0 compatibility decision changed only `pageSize` to `maxResults`.
//     Standardizing the rest needs a coordinated, versioned API change.
// Wire-format notes:
//   - Every response body is a JSend envelope: `{ status, data }` on success and
//     `{ status, message?, data? }` on failure.
//   - Pagination and collection fields use the wire names `pageIdentifier`,
//     `nextPageIdentifier`, and `result`; resource identifiers use `uuid`. The
//     page-size query parameter is `maxResults`.
/// Innovation Sandbox on AWS enables cloud administrators to automate the
/// management of temporary sandbox environments by implementing service
/// control policies, spend controls, and account recycling mechanisms.
///
/// The API is organized into these domains:
///
/// - **Accounts**: Register and manage sandbox accounts, cleanup runs, and
///   account lifecycle actions.
/// - **Blueprints**: Register and manage CloudFormation StackSet-backed
///   blueprints.
/// - **Configurations**: Read and update solution settings for leases, cleanup,
///   notifications, maintenance, terms of service, and cost reporting.
/// - **Leases**: Request and manage temporary sandbox access, lifecycle actions,
///   sharing, and principal assignments.
/// - **Lease templates**: Define the reusable budget, duration, blueprint, and
///   visibility settings used to request leases.
/// - **Principals**: Search IAM Identity Center users and groups for lease
///   assignments.
