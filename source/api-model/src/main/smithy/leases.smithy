// Per-domain service for the leases Lambda. It binds only this domain's eleven
// operations, so the generated `LeasesApiService` types the Lambda's handler to
// exactly these — while the aggregate `IsbApi` (main.smithy) binds the same
// operations for the shared client/OpenAPI.
//
// Server-only: this service feeds only the `server-leases` SSDK projection. It
// deliberately omits the `@service` (sdkId) and `@sigv4` traits that `IsbApi`
// carries — a client/CLI must be generated from the aggregate `IsbApi`, never from
// a per-domain service (auth is enforced by middleware ahead of the Smithy handler).
//
// Accepted deviations (documented, consistent with the other domains; see
// `zod-validation-supplements.md` and `timestamp-modeling.md`):
//   1. Status-conditional requiredness is FLATTENED to an optional superset. The
//      persisted `Lease` is a Zod discriminatedUnion of Pending / ApprovalDenied /
//      Monitored / Expired, each of which makes a different set of members
//      `@required`. Smithy has no discriminated-union-with-per-variant-requiredness,
//      so the wire `Lease` is the UNION of every variant's members with ONLY the
//      always-present intersection marked `@required` (`userEmail`, `uuid`,
//      `status`, `originalLeaseTemplateUuid`, `originalLeaseTemplateName`).
//      Status-specific members (`awsAccountId`, `approvedBy`, `startDate`,
//      `expirationDate`, `lastCheckedDate`, `totalCostAccrued`, `endDate`, `ttl`)
//      are optional in the superset. The runtime `is*Lease` guards remain
//      OPERATION logic (they gate state transitions), not request-shape validation.
//   2. `meta.schemaVersion` is dropped from the wire (persisted, never a public
//      field), exactly as `AccountMetadata` does — only the timestamps are public.
//   3. ALL lease timestamps are modeled as raw `String`, not `@timestamp`
//      (`startDate`, `expirationDate`, `lastCheckedDate`, `endDate`, the lock's
//      `acquiredAt`/`expiresAt`, `LeaseMetadata` times, `AssignmentView.addedDate`).
//      The handler returns persisted strings through `JSON.stringify`; the frontend
//      reads them directly. `DynamoLeaseStore.update` carries a `meta.lastEditTime`
//      conditional, but the PATCH path never passes `expected`, so there is no API
//      concurrency dependency on a byte-faithful echo today (the same latent trap as
//      leaseTemplates — but leases chose `String` for byte-faithful passthrough).
//   4. `maxResults` on the list operations is parsed by the generated
//      `restJson1` deserializer (`strictParseInt32`): a plain decimal integer only.
//      The pre-Smithy `z.coerce.number()` also accepted a leading `+`, leading
//      zeros, surrounding whitespace, and hex; those spellings now return 400. A
//      well-formed in-range integer is unaffected. The same cross-domain pagination
//      tightening documented for Accounts.
//   5. The 429 rate-limit response (`data.retryAt`, thrown by
//      `LeaseRequestRateLimitExceededError`) is a DELEGATED JSend error and is NOT
//      modeled — matching the no-typed-model convention for handler-thrown errors
//      that carry a custom payload.
//   6. `RequestLease` / `UpdateLease` / `UpdateLeaseAssignments` keep a strict Zod
//      re-parse (unknown-key rejection, cross-field/format rules, null-to-clear
//      semantics on PATCH) as an OPERATION supplement. `ReviewLease` also re-parses
//      its body `.strict()` (only to reject unknown keys — the model already
//      validates the `action` enum), and `ListSharedLeases` re-validates its
//      `userId` query param's IDC-principal-id format (modeled as an open
//      `String`). All enumerated in `zod-validation-supplements.md`.
//   7. Persisted `null` read-path members are DROPPED from the wire, not emitted as
//      `null`. `approvedBy`, `awsAccountId`, `blueprintId`, and `blueprintName` are
//      commonly persisted as `null` (blueprint-less templates, un-approved or
//      un-provisioned leases), and the pre-Smithy handler returned them as explicit
//      `null` via `JSON.stringify`. The `restJson1` serializer omits a structure
//      member whose value is `null`, so these appear absent rather than `null` on
//      the wire. This IS an observable wire-format change (absent vs explicit
//      `null`) with no *current* frontend behavior change — every consumer treats an
//      absent member and a `null` member identically (all four are optional), though
//      a future consumer distinguishing the two would see it. Distinct from
//      deviation #2 (`schemaVersion`, never public) and #3 (timestamps as `String`).

// The null-to-clear mapping is a Zod re-parse concern that `restJson1` cannot
// express, so the nullable members are modeled as plain optional members and the
// mapping stays operation logic. Unknown keys and cross-field budget/duration rules
// are enforced by the Zod re-parse.
/// Update a monitored (active) lease. PATCH semantics: every body member is
/// optional. Returns the updated lease (200) WITHOUT a `leaseId`. The nullable
/// members (`maxSpend`, `expirationDate`, `costReportGroup`) accept an explicit
/// `null` to CLEAR the value. Non-monitored leases are rejected 400
/// (`ValidationError`); a missing lease is 404.
