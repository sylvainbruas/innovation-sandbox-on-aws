 * Returns group-to-lease associations that the configured mode rejects.
 * `NONE` means no new associations: users remain allowed, while a group is allowed
 * only when that same group is already associated with this lease. Existing groups
 * can therefore remain, be removed, and continue through lifecycle operations such
 * as approval. Principal search is gated separately so `NONE` does not expose group
 * discovery.
 *
 * This check intentionally relies on the supplied principal type. Before access is
 * granted, assignment processing resolves the principal ID in IDC as that type; a
 * group submitted as a user therefore fails user resolution instead of bypassing
 * this policy.
