# Prepares the aws-nuke config for a cleanup run: merges the ISB overlay into the
# customer's config, substitutes the %PLACEHOLDER% tokens, and appends the managed
# regions.
#
# ISB-required entries live in a separate overlay rather than in the shipped nuke
# config, because that config becomes an AppConfig hosted configuration the customer
# is expected to customize — a release editing it would supersede their edits. The
# overlay ships in this image beside the aws-nuke binary because its keys are Nuke
# resource-type identifiers and must move with the Nuke version.
#
# Not idempotent: it runs once per build against a freshly fetched config. Re-running
# would append a second account block, since the overlay's %CLEANUP_ACCOUNT_ID% key
# would no longer match the substituted key in the config.
#
# Usage:
#   isb-prepare-nuke-config --config <path> --account-id <id> --hub-account-id <id> \
#                           --role-name <name> --regions <comma-separated>
